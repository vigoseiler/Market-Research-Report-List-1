<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The R402b Refrigerant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Steel Cylinders</li><li>Refillsble Steel Cylinders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The R402B refrigerant market primarily consists of two types of storage solutions: disposable steel cylinders and refillable steel cylinders. Disposable steel cylinders are designed for single use, making them convenient for applications needing a small quantity of refrigerant, but they contribute to waste after use. In contrast, refillable steel cylinders are more sustainable, allowing users to recharge the cylinder multiple times, which is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Both types cater to different user needs and compliance with safety regulations.</p></p>
